The app’s main activity displays a
grid whose cells contain a thumbnail picture of a car (from outside the car) above the name of the car’s manufacturer.
For instance, a grid cell could contain a thumbnail showing a Mazda 3, above the name “Mazda
3”. The thumbnails are separated by thin
spaces (no more than 5 dp) uniformly on all four sides when the grid is displayed on a Pixel 2 device. Also,
size the thumbnails appropriately, e.g., using 2 or 3 columns in portrait mode. 

Each grid cell supports two kinds of functionality, depending on whether an app viewer performs a
short vs. a long click on the cell. A short click brings up a new activity that shows the entire picture of
the selected car on the entire device display. This picture must be a higher resolution and bigger than the
thumbnail displayed earlier. The user can return to the grid view by selecting the “back” soft button on
the phone. If, instead, a user clicks anywhere on the displayed picture, you must open a browser activity
showing the web site of the car’s manufacturer. For instance, if your app shows a picture of a Mazda 3, the
app should bring up the Mazda 3’s web page from the official Mazda web site.

A long click on a grid cell brings up a “context menu” showing the following three options for the car
under consideration: 
	(1) View the entire picture (similar to a short click); 
	(2) Show the official web page of the car manufacturer in a new activity; and 
	(3) bring up a list view containing the names and addresses of at least three car dealers for the selected manufacturer in greater Chicago area.
